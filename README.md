Personal Portfolio Website 
Overview
This project is a Personal Portfolio Website assignment, aimed at designing and developing a single-page portfolio to showcase your skills, projects, and contact information. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and focuses on delivering a visually appealing and responsive design that works seamlessly across both desktop and mobile devices.

Features
Layout and Design

The website features a clean, visually appealing design with a smooth layout.
It includes the following sections:
About Me: Introduction and background information.
Projects: Display of at least two project cards with titles, descriptions, and links.
Skills: Overview of key technical skills.
Contact: A contact form for visitors to get in touch.
Navigation

A fixed navigation bar is implemented, which allows smooth scrolling between sections.
The navbar remains at the top of the page while scrolling to ensure ease of navigation.
Responsive Design

The site is fully responsive, optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
CSS media queries ensure proper scaling and arrangement of content based on screen size.
Interactivity

Buttons and links feature hover effects for an enhanced user experience.
A simple contact form is included in the Contact section with fields for name, email, and message. Note: form submission is not functional and is only for demonstration purposes.
